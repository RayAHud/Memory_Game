Install

    This game's main file is index.html.

        Leave all the files where they are after you unzip R_Hudson_Memory_Game.unzip
        Open index.html and the game should appear in your default web browser.
            This program uses a javascript code named app.js found in the js folder

            as long as you leave everything where it is when unzipped, the program should work.

How to play

    The game starts as soon as the page loads.
    Try and use your brain to match all of the cards.
    There are 8 pairs of cards hidden in the beginning.
    As you click the cards they will show their hidden symbols.
    After two cards have been clicked, the revealed cards will hide themselves, but remain in the same spot.
    If the two cards match they will change color and remain revealed.
    Once you have Revealed all the cards... You Win!!!

    There is a timer to help you keep track of how long you are taking.
    There is a move counter to tell you how many tries you have taken.
    The three stars represent your performance.
        The stars will decrease the more moves you take.
        Try to take as few moves as possible to end the game with all three stars.

    Hit the restart button to reshuffle the card position and start all over.

Dependencies

    This program uses jQuery, javascript, css, and html.
